    _description: Hello to all Sokoban Lovers.I'm an avid player of this mind games.to
      date I have more than 8,000 levels all with solutions.It's like a medicine whenever
      I solve some levels with much difficulty.It took me sometimes, days before I
      solve it.If your interested in obtaining solutions to some levels you can e-mail
      me together with a copy of the levels you want to be solve.I would recommend
      to use the ysokoban program because it is much easier to use and besides less
      tiring for your hands because all you need to use is your mouse keys just click
      the box and the destination and presto! it will go there to the shortest possible
      route.besides you will be able to save your solutions and go back to it in case
      you are wondering how you will be able to solve it.I have gone also to some
      sokoban solutions site but the one that I'm most interested to solve are not
      in their database.I even downloaded some sokoban solver program but to my dismay
      some failed to solve them even those that are easiest.So I make it a challenge
      that those level which these solver were'nt able to solve.I try to solve it
      myself.I get the feeling that If I solve some levels which the computer failed
      to solve.I feel like superior to the computer.So now here's your chance to solve
      that nagging levels which even in your sleep still lingering in your mind.You
      can contact me at this number 00639054446676 .I will give you my full support
      24 hours a day.I even convert levels from other sokoban games into txt or xsb
      format.Pls specify which format you like to send to you. Thank you.
